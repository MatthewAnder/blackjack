# Jack n' Co

## A game of blackjack with a little twist.

### What will the application do? <br>
The application is a game of **blackjack**, but with a twist which is the user can take one card and hold it.
Later, the user can put it back again and can do some sort of a **combo**. Instead of receiving the card from the dealer, 
the user can use his or her own cards. The combos can earn the user extra **money**. The leaderboard would showcase the amount of money the users made in an hour.
### Who will use it? <br>
Mostly people that is **bored** with work and university life will play this game for **entertainment**.

### Why is this project of interest to you? <br>
I am interested in making this game because of the logic behind the game. It is simple yet complex at the same time.
